# NumericTextField

This package provides a SwiftUI View called NumericTextField. This is a TextView wrapped in a little bit of code to prevent the user entering anything other than numbers (and, if the underlying number type supports it, a decimal point).

This first release is VERY rough around the edges and is provided as-is. I'll be adding features and fixing bugs as I come across them when using this in my own apps.
